ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on : 

- :video_game:  a story driven turn based game (more to come soon) 

- :space_invader: a Zerg Starcraft Broodwar bot

- :flower_playing_cards: a trading card game called Stralings (and a handy tool for its playtesting)
  You can find and buy the starter decks of this card game here : https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/stralings-starter-decks


:bulb: I always push myself to be creative and optimize my projects which you can find here on GitHub!
